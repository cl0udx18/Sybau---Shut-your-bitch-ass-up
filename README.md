# Sybau---Shut-your-bitch-ass-up
A minimal CLI wrapper that suppresses noisy command output and shows only meaningful signals.
Thanks to a comment on a reddit post on r/masterhacker I got the idea about this simple tool.
Credit goes to u/YOUDONTGETMEWRONG and me ^_^
## Usage
```bash
sybau <command> [args]
